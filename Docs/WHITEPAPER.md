# Roots of Gaia (ROG) Whitepaper

## 1. Abstract
Roots of Gaia (ROG) is a regenerative blockchain initiative designed to fund environmental restoration and empower indigenous communities. Built on Polygon, ROG combines transparent donations, tokenized participation, and decentralized governance to create measurable real-world impact.

## 2. Problem Statement
Global ecosystems are collapsing, and indigenous communities face cultural erasure and economic marginalization. Traditional donation systems lack transparency and scalability. ROG addresses these gaps by creating a decentralized funding and reward system for verified ecological and cultural projects.

## 3. Vision & Objectives
- Restore ecosystems through traceable funding
- Empower indigenous sovereignty and land reclamation
- Incentivize eco-actions via real-world events and Tribes App
- Build a DAO-governed regenerative economy

## 4. Technology Stack
- Polygon (ERC-20)
- Safe multisig wallets (Gnosis Safe)
- Snapshot for DAO voting
- Tribes App (use-to-earn mobile platform)
- Polygonscan, CoinGecko, MetaMask integrations
